## README

Playground to learn more about C++.

### Common commands
* `gcc cpp_playground/helloWorld.c -o cpp_playground/helloWorld`
  * This creates a C++ compiled file named "helloWorld" in the same directory as our source file
* `cpp_playground/helloWorld`
  * This will actually execute the file

Note, there is an extension in VS Code named "CodeRunner" that both compiles and runs your code by clicking the VS Code
"Run Code" button (ctrl + option + N on mac)
